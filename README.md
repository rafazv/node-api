# Blog API

This is a Node.js app that uses Express framework with MongoDB (Mongoose) to create a API REST for a blog that contents users and posts.

## Before You Begin

Before you begin check about the basic building blocks that assemble this application:

- MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](https://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
- Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/).
- Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

## Quick Install

To install the dependencies for the server, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
npm install
```

Obs.: You need to install MongoDB to use the application.
